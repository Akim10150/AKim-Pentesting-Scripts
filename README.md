# AKim Pentesting Scripts

FileExfiltrator
Here are Windows/Linux Python Client/Server for searching for and exfiltrating files. 
These scripts may prove useful when exfiltrating files through conventional ways (nc,etc) are unavailable, but python is.
Making a "Frozen Binary" may also help, and may circumvent the use of python. To us these scripts, simply run the server with 
a bind address and port, and then run the client on the machine with the files to exfiltrate. Merely enter the parameters requested
upon running the scripts, and wait :)!

FileEncrypter
Ever wonder how easy Ransomware is to code?
Here, you will find some "Proof of Concept" Scripts which can be used to demonstrate how a ransomware attack could potentially occur.
These scripts exhibit the use of symmetric key cryptography that could be potentially used for this type of attack.
Use responsibly! I'm not responsible for any damages which may be incurred. To use, simply run the Encrypter, and specify the file extensions or filename of the files you wish to be encrypted. This will generate a key, and a list of files that have been encrypted. Run the decrypter with the contents of the key file, and the files will be restored. Enjoy!
